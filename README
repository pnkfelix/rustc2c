The goal of this project is to provide a small shim of C-compatible
bindings around the Rust compiler `rustc`.

My end goal is to be able to access `libsyntax` and librustc` from
other linguistic environments such as Java (e.g. for Eclipse) and
Scheme (e.g. for DrRacket).  The C language is just the lowest common
denominator that all systems should be able to agree on in their
FFI's.

The main testbed will probably be a C client (since everyone should be
able to grok C) and a Racket client (since that's what I care most
about in the short term).  See the `c_smoke_test` and `rkt_smoke_test`
targets in the Makefile.
